Hi, this is my graduation project from the course TopJava.

There are two types of users:
User;
Admin;

User votes from the estaurant where he will diner.

Admin updates a new menu for restaurants every day.

Technology stack:
- Spring framework;
- Spring data;
- Spring MVC;
- Spring security;
- Maven;
- Git;
- JPA(Hibernate);
- Postgresql;
